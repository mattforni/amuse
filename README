<Project> Amuse
<@uthor>  Matt Fornaciari

Amuse is essentially a java-based MP3 player.  I opted to build the gui with swing, but I hope to eventually change it to a gtk derivative.
This readme describes the functionality and design choice.

Controls Quick Reference  |
===========================
ctrl + n  |   new playlist
ctrl + q  |   quit

ctrl + s  |   save to the default library path
ctrl + l  |   load from the default library path


Functionality |
===============
  - supports valid mp3 files controlled via simple control panel at the top of the gui
    -- play
    -- forward
    -- backward
  - contains a progress bar
    -- static when no mp3 is being played
    -- model when mp3 is playing
  - contains a playlist panel
    -- displays all actively not empty playlists
    -- playlists can be added via the menu bar (or hotkey**CTRL+N)
    -- right-click  ||  on a playlist gives you the ability to edit the name
    -- left-click   ||  displays the clicked upon playlist
  - contains a library panel
    -- displays the songs contains in the current playlist
    -- left-click   ||  fields 'id' 'plays' 'path' select the corresponding song
    -- middle-click ||  field  'id' displays the add to playlist frame
    -- right-click  ||  fields 'title' 'artist' gives you the ability to edit title, artist
  - contains a very minimal add bar
    -- simply enter the title, artist and path and click the add button


Design  |
=========
  - all based on an enum-based array (enum Field) of vectors
    -- establishes a fixed size database based on the number of fields

  - the mp3 playback is all based on jl1.0.jar, mp3spi1.9.4.jar, tritonus_share.jar jars which
    act as a layer of abstraction between the java sound api and my AmusePlayer.

  - the amuse player simply acts as a basic thread - executor pool of fixed size one.
  - it keeps track of which thread is currently playing, and when a new one is selected
    it properly disposes of the mp3 thread, creates a new one and starts the thread.

Lastly, I included a test_library.xml.  Currently the library.xml file is just a copy of this file
but if you overwrite it, simply create another copy and remove the preceding 'test_', then run
Amuse and load the library.


ENJOY.
